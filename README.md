# Stardew Valley Wear OS Watchface
## Description
I made a Stardew Valley themed watch face for Wear OS smartwatches with KWCH.

## Features
![Stardew Valley DEMO Github](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abfa6f48-88a1-4c74-9ab3-c7cb0bbba232)

The watchface displays the following information:
- **Time**: 12/24 hours format can be changed in KWCH
- **Date**
- **Battery**: The health and energie bars show the battery status of the watch (W) and phone (P). The color of the bars changes if you lose energy/battery. The exhaustion symbol is display when the battery is below 15%.
- **Steps**: Instead of gold, the current number of steps (S) is displayed.
- **Temperature**: In addition to the steps counter, there is a second couter showing the current tempature.
- **Daily calender event**: When you have a daily calender event, the Journal icon is displayed. The icon also functions as shortcut to open the calender app on the watch.
- **Seasons icon**: The icons of the season changes according to the acctual current season.
- **Temperature icon**: The temperature icon can currently not be changed based on the real weather. Therefore always the festival symbol is displayed.

To display the number of steps correctly, the first complication of the watch face must be set to “Steps”.
